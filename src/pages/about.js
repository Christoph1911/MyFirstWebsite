      <p>
        Currently I'm in high school and go in the 11th grade.
        I've been on a two week student exchange in Ingatestone (a small town near London), which was a very cool and interesting experience.
        I've done a one week internship at <a href="https://flowkey.breezy.hr">flowkey</a>, a startup in Berlin.
