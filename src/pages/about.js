      <p>
        Currently I'm in high school and go in the 11th grade.
        I've been on a two week student exchange in Ingatestone (a small town near London), which was a very cool and interesting experience.
        I've done a one week internship at <a href="https://flowkey.breezy.hr">flowkey</a>, a startup in Berlin, where I learned to build this website and other things.

        I'm interested in programming and have tried a few different programming languages: C#, Java, Javascript, Python. I got into programming in school, where I started eperimenting with the Arduino.
        Other hobbys are Karate , playing the saxophone and chess.

        My greatest passion is speedcubing (You try to solve the rubik's cube and other twisty puzzles as quickly as possible).
